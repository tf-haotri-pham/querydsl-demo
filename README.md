Run Spring Boot app _rest_service_ with profile _**local**_ 
in order to pick up the default external dependency configurations 
prepared in file _application-local.properties_ (such as PostgreSQL
database access information).

Navigate to the Spring Boot app's base URL address (e.g. http://localhost:3030/) 
to be redirected to the Swagger UI documentation page .
